# Docker Tools GUI

## Description

New and improved layer for graphical Docker Tools

## How it Works

The Base image will run a VNC server and a noVNC web server. This will allow an application to run in the for-ground and be accessible from the browser.

Application will run in a single docker container to keep things simple however can be extended to use external VNC server as well.
